Requirements:

Download the .fig file above and import it into Figma. (On the files/drafts page, click on Import file and import the downloaded .fig file.)
Recreate the mockup using HTML/CSS.
Extract the image.
Find the font-family, colours and other settings (e.g. drop shadow) using the mockup.
Use a content wrapper to restrict the content to a certain width. There is no layout grid as the mockup is very simple but you can use guides to determine the outermost range of the content.
There are no components with hover variants so you may extrapolate from the colours used in the design to come up with your own link hover colours if you wish.
Put your CSS and image files in subdirectories.


Zip up the HTML, CSS, and image files and submit via Blackboard. Name your ZIP using the format: HTML-Lab6-JohnDoe.zip. This is an individual lab.
